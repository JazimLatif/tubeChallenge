# Tube Challenge

## Important Notes

### Permissions
To use the app's features, **notification** and **camera** permissions must be manually enabled in your device settings. Make sure you grant these permissions to ensure the app functions correctly.

### Viewing Logs
Logs can be viewed through **Android Studio** by manually inspecting the database.  
You need to run the app in **debug mode** for this to work, as logs cannot be accessed in **release mode**.

### Camera Issues
The camera has been somewhat finicky, sometimes taking blank photos in addition to the actual photo you want. Please use the camera carefully and keep this in mind when capturing photos.  
As a precaution, don't rely solely on the camera for capturing images. You will need a video recording of the entire process anyway, which can be used as a backup.

### Stopwatch Usage
To stop the stopwatch, press the button for **3 seconds**. This is done intentionally to prevent accidental presses. However, note that this time will not be accounted for in the final time recorded.  
As a result, you should subtract **3 seconds** from the final time for a more accurate estimate of how long you took.


### In the event of a crash
Don't worry, there's no way any previous logs have been deleted, just keep going with the challenge and ignore the stopwatch time (it's kind of irrelevant anyway since you'll know what time you started etc)
